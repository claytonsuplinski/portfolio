	"description": [
		"By working with some SPICE Data kernels for the Venus orbiter Akatsuki, I've been able to write C++ programs to calculate different quantites for the Japanese satellite.",
		"With help from the built-in SPICE library, one of the programs is able to calculate occultations of the satellite by Venus to determine optimal times for data transmission.",
		"Along with this, another program works with the SPICE kernels to derive coordinates of Akatsuki along its orbit over a given time range.",
		"Using these results, Akatsuki has become an interesting addition to WxSatS and has allowed that project to expand to other planets in the Solar System."

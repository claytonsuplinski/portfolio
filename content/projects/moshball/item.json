		"Moshball is a video game where the user must control a ball and collide with all the other balls before all their timers run out.",
		"This project has multiple other game modes where the user can play in different environments with different rules.",
		"In some settings, the user must collect as many objects as possible while the game speeds up.",
		"And to make things more difficult, there are options to add in a foe who will chase you throughout the map."

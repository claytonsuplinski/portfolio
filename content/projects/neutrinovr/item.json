		"This project was conducted during a summer internship and involved creating a 3D virtual reality visualization of the IceCube array of neutrino detectors in Antarctica.",
		"Optimized to run in an immersive VR environment, this project provides a unique viewpoint beneath the ice.",
		"By using virtual reality and 3D techniques, the user is able to visualize the science behind the detector array and see the neutrinos make their way through the ice over time.",
		"The project contains high amount of detail in the detectors, photon paths, and the facility up on the surface."

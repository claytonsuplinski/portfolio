		"The Inventory Dashboard is a webpage designed to manage the satellite inventory at the SSEC.",
		"This page automatically checks the inventory database for missing images, reports it to the user, and allows them to update the inventory webpage accordingly.",
		"Several needs were met by this page as it reduced the amount of manual work and simplified the role for new people checking the inventory."

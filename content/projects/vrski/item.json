		"In my final semester as an undergrad at UW Madison, I created this virtual reality ski simulator as an independent study project.",
		"There are two versions of this program, the first completed by October and the second completed in December.",
		"The first is a simpler and shorter ski hill, designed to showcase the program at the 2014 Wisconsin Science Festival.",
		"The second is a Christmas-themed longer run, featuring more special effects, moving obstacles, and more intricate jumps.",
		"Both versions were created using the Unity game engine and use the Microsoft Kinect as a controller."

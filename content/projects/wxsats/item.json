		"WXSATS is a WebGL-based 3D visualization of all the satellites that transmit data to the Space Science and Engineering Center.", 
		"This project has become a useful educational tool at the SSEC as it accurately illustrates real time satellite movements and provides hourly imagery of the Earth.", 
		"Over time it has evolved into a larger project encompassing other planets, moons, stars, and asteroids.", 
		"Additionally, WXSATS has provided outlets for collaboration within the building by providing effective ways to illustrate events in the news and display satellites orbiting other planets."

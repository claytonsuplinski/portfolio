		"This OpenGL project procedurally generates large-scale environments with elements placed in them such as buildings, bridges, and trees.",
		"Through different optimization techniques, this program is able to manage environments that scale to the size of some small countries.",
		"In addition to the terrain, different shader and rendering techniques were used to create the water, clouds, and horizon to enhance the overall experience."

		"Cow Catchers is a video game created with the Unity game engine where the user flys around in a ufo and tries to collect as many cows as possible before time runs out.",
		"While doing so, the user must avoid hitting any terrain or obstacles or else the spaceship will explode on contact.",
		"There are several playable maps in the game, which allows the user to collect cows in varying levels of difficulty based on the environment.",
		"Additionally the web version maintains global high scores for each level, which gives each user a goal to aim for when collecting cows."

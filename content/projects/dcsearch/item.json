		"DC Search is a simple, but useful utility that essentially turned into a search engine for the Data Center.",
		"By taking either keywords or web addresses as search terms, this page helps employees in the Data Center find the webpages they're looking for in a quick and easy way.",
		"This page provides an excellent compliment to the DC Checks pages and helps to condense information for new employees."

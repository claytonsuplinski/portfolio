		"The EarthNow Climate Digest is a quarterly report that focuses on recent weather activity.",
		"One part of the project is to create a youtube video to illustrate global trends in temperature, precipitation, and snow cover.",
		"In association with this, there is also the Science on a Sphere part which projects the weather data on a physical sphere to give unique perspectives for educational demonstrations.",
		"My involvement with this ongoing project began with the December 2015 Climate Digest."

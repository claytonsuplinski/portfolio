		"This WebGL project was developed as a quick reference utility at the Data Center.",
		"With the ability to visualize the machines in the Data Center in a 3D space, this program allows users to quickly find what they are looking for.",
		"By allowing the user to search for machines or racks by name, it turns a tedious task into a trivial one.",
		"And by having an accurate depiction of the room, the user is able to gain a strong sense for the location of the desired machine."

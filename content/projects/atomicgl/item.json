		"AtomicGL is a webpage designed to show what various atoms from the periodic table look like in an interactive 3D space.",
		"These atoms are algorithmically generated and allow the user to either select atoms from a dropdown list or create custom atoms by adjusting the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons.",
		"All the components of the atoms are color-coded by particle type and energy level to help illustrate fundamental concepts in chemistry.",
		"The WebGL backend created in this program was later expanded on in the Planetary Terrains and War Zone Tracker projects"

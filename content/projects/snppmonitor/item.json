		"The SNPP Monitor is a page used to visualize the real-time stats of ingested SNPP data at the SSEC.",
		"By having a python script do all the harvesting and processing behind the scenes, it allows tables and charts to load quickly while keeping the data fresh.",
		"In addition to monitoring incoming times and bytes, the SNPP Monitor notes ftp lock times and determines the order in which products will be arriving.",
		"This project uses the same javascript backend as the XCD Monitor page."

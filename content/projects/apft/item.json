		"The APFT Toolbox was developed as an Android application to help ROTC cadets manage their training progress.",
		"A major part of the ROTC program is the Army Physical Fitness Test, and this app helps to minimize the tedious parts of recording these results.",
		"This app maintains a database of cadets who each have their push-up, situp, and running stats.",
		"Those supervising the tests are able to manage these stats through the administrator mode and provide feedback through the leaderboard and cadet profiles."
